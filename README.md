Strindberg is the Markdown editor I've always wanted.

Background
----------

Over the years I've developed an elaborate writing workflow based around
Markdown, Git, and LaTeX. I love the simplicity of Markdown, the peace
of mind provided by Git, and the world-class typesetting of LaTeX.
However, this workflow requires a lot of specific software and knowledge
to be usable. Strindberg brings the ultimate writing workflow to the
web.

Features
--------

-   Files are automatically saved with version control.
-   Write in your markup language of choice, including Markdown, LaTeX,
    HTML, Mediawiki, and many more.
-   Generate any output format imaginable. PDF, HTML5 slideshows,
    Microsoft .docx, ODT, ePub, etc.
-   Full LaTeX equation support.
-   Word count updates as you type so you know exactly when the project
    is finished ;)
-   Split-screen no-distractions mode with a preview that updates as you
    type.

Technology
----------

-   Built with [Meteor](http://meteor.com/).
-   Used MongoDB.
-   Used Node.js.
-   [Open source on
    GitHub](https://github.com/zacharydenton/strindberg).
